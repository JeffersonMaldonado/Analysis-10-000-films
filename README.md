# Analysis-10-000-films

In this project I intend to analyze a database of 10,000 films that were evaluated on the tmdb website. The films have user ratings, budgets and production revenues. It includes the names of the actors, directors and producer involved in the project. The main objective of the project is to answer questions and the development of the film industry from the user's point of view. So what are the most popular genres year after year, what are the main features that make movies make the most revenue. In addition, I will try to find more information about the quality of this data set.
